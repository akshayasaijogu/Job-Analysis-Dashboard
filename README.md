# Job Market Analysis Dashboard 
**Data Analytics | Data Visualization | Tableau Dashboard**

## Project Overview

This project showcases **Job Market Analysis Dashboard** built using **Tableau Public**, with a primary focus on exploring hiring trends and skill demands across industries between **2018 and 2020**. The dashboard enables students, professionals, and recruiters to uncover **key insights** from historical job data and make **data-driven career decisions**.


## Objectives

* Analyze real-world job listing data to identify in-demand skills and technologies.
* Examine salary trends across years, experience levels, education, and roles.
* Reveal insights on job satisfaction in relation to compensation.
* Provide an interactive decision-support tool for job seekers, students, and industry professionals.
* Understand developer preferences and future expectations in the tech landscape.

  
## Tools & Technologies

* **Tableau Public** – Dashboard creation and visual storytelling
* **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – Supportive exploratory visuals during analysis
* **Dataset Source** – Public job data collected for 2018–202


## Key Features of the Dashboard                             

* **Median Salary Trend (2018–2020)      
* **Salary vs. Experience Level           
* **Average Salary by Education Level      
* **Job Satisfaction vs. Salary Comparison
* **Average Salary by Developer Type     
* **Top 10 Desired Programming Languages  


## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   * Gathered job listings and survey-based datasets spanning 2018–2020.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)**
   * Handled missing values, normalized categorical variables, and extracted skill patterns.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   * Cleaned missing values, normalized role and skill fields, converted salary ranges.
   * Transformed education, experience, and developer types into usable formats.
   * Identified major patterns in job roles, salary variations, and regional hiring activity.

4. **Dashboard Development (Tableau Public)**
   * Built an intuitive, interactive dashboards using calculated fields, filters, and chart types (maps, bar charts, heatmaps).
   * Optimized layout for user-friendly navigation and impactful storytelling.
   * Designed filters for developer type, education level, and year selection to allow user-level control.


## Insights Derived
* Median salaries steadily increased from 2018 to 2020, reflecting evolving demand in tech sectors.
* Experienced professionals consistently earned more, with sharp growth visible after 5+ years of experience.
* Higher education levels (Master’s and above) were associated with better average compensation.
* Job satisfaction was positively correlated with salary, though outliers existed.
* Back-end, full-stack, and data scientists had the highest average salaries among developer types.
* Python, JavaScript, and Go emerged as top desired languages for upcoming years.

## Conclusion

This project involved working with real-world job data to understand important patterns in salaries, skills, education, and job satisfaction from 2018 to 2020. It helped me strengthen my skills in:
- Collecting and cleaning data
- Analyzing trends using Python
- Designing a user-friendly dashboard in Tableau
- Presenting results clearly to support job-related decisions

The final dashboard gives a clear view of job market trends and is useful for students, job seekers, and professionals who want to make informed choices about their careers. It also shows my ability to handle each stage of a project — from raw data to final presentation — in a structured and meaningful way.
